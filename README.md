# Lilith: A 2.5D First Person Shooter in Unity

This project is a simple first person shooter created in Unity and coded in C#. It utilizes sprites rather than 3D models to represent objects in the game world, much like early 90's shooters such as Doom and Marathon. It has basic features such as player movement (jumping, crouching, etc.), enemy AI (monsters and turrets), and shooting.

This repository hosts all of the scripts used in the game. All code generally follows C# formatting conventions. Sources are cited within the code where appropriate.
